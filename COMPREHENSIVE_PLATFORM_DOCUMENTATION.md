## 2. Data Model

The MamaCare AI platform utilizes a comprehensive relational database schema consisting of 11 core models that establish complex relationships through foreign key constraints, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval. The data model is built using SQLAlchemy ORM, which provides database-agnostic code that currently uses SQLite for development but seamlessly transitions to PostgreSQL for production deployments. The central entity in the data model is the User model, which stores authentication credentials, user profiles, and role information (patient, provider, or government). Each user can have multiple Pregnancy records, representing different pregnancy instances, with each pregnancy containing multiple HealthRecord entries that track vital signs and health metrics over time.

The RiskAssessment model stores the results of AI-powered risk predictions, including risk levels (Low, Medium, High), risk scores (0-100%), detected risk factors, personalized recommendations, and confidence scores, with each assessment linked to both a pregnancy and the specific health record used for the prediction. The Appointment model manages medical appointments, linking patients with healthcare providers and associating appointments with specific pregnancies. The EmergencyContact and EmergencyAlert models handle the emergency response system, storing emergency contact information and alert history with geolocation data. The Hospital model maintains a directory of healthcare facilities with location and specialty information, while the SubscriptionPlan and UserSubscription models manage the freemium subscription system. The Translation model stores multilingual content for the platform's language support feature, and the OfflineSync model tracks offline data synchronization states for conflict resolution. The Entity-Relationship diagram (referenced in ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md, Section "Database Schema Architecture") illustrates these relationships, showing how User entities connect to Pregnancy records, which in turn link to HealthRecord and RiskAssessment entries, creating a comprehensive data structure that supports the platform's analytical and predictive capabilities while maintaining referential integrity through foreign key constraints.

## 5. Troubleshooting Guides

The MamaCare AI platform includes comprehensive troubleshooting mechanisms and error handling strategies to ensure system reliability and user experience. Common issues that users may encounter include authentication problems, such as forgotten passwords or expired JWT tokens, which are addressed through the login system that validates credentials using bcrypt password verification and generates new tokens with 24-hour expiration periods. If users experience authentication failures, the system provides clear error messages indicating whether the issue is with email/password credentials or token expiration, and the frontend automatically redirects users to the login page when tokens expire or become invalid. For health record creation issues, the system validates all input data through Pydantic schemas, ensuring that vital signs fall within acceptable ranges and providing user-friendly error messages if validation fails. The platform includes comprehensive error logging throughout the application, with structured logging that captures error details, user context, and system state, enabling developers to diagnose issues quickly.

For machine learning prediction failures, the system includes fallback mechanisms that check model availability before processing requests, and if models fail to load or predictions encounter errors, the system logs detailed error information and returns appropriate error responses to users. The offline synchronization system handles data conflicts through timestamp-based conflict resolution, prioritizing the most recent data while preserving user intent, and if synchronization fails, the system stores data locally and retries when connectivity is restored. WebSocket connection issues are handled through automatic reconnection logic that attempts to re-establish connections when they drop, ensuring real-time updates continue to function even with intermittent connectivity. For emergency alert failures, the system includes retry mechanisms for SMS sending through Twilio, and if SMS sending fails, the system still creates alert records in the database and broadcasts through WebSocket connections, ensuring emergency notifications reach users through at least one channel. The platform's API includes comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 404 for not found resources, 500 for server errors), and all error responses include descriptive messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues. The frontend application includes loading states, error boundaries, and user-friendly error messages that guide users through resolving common problems without requiring technical support.

## 6. Standard Tasks

The MamaCare AI platform supports a comprehensive set of standard tasks that users perform regularly to manage their maternal health. For patients, standard tasks include user registration and authentication, where new users create accounts by providing email, password, full name, and role information, with the system automatically hashing passwords using bcrypt and generating JWT tokens for authenticated sessions. Once logged in, patients can create and manage pregnancy records, entering pregnancy start dates, due dates, and healthcare provider information, with the system automatically calculating gestational age in weeks and trimesters. Health record management is a core standard task, where users log vital signs including weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, BMI, and heart rate, with each record automatically associated with the user's active pregnancy and timestamped for historical tracking.

Risk assessment is a critical standard task that users perform regularly, where the system takes the latest health record data, performs feature engineering to create a 20-feature vector, runs the machine learning model prediction, and returns a comprehensive risk assessment including risk level (Low, Medium, High), risk score (0-100%), detected risk factors, and personalized recommendations. Users can view their risk assessment history, track changes in risk levels over time, and access personalized recommendations based on their current health status. Appointment management allows users to schedule, view, and manage medical appointments with healthcare providers, with appointments displaying associated risk levels to help providers prioritize care. Emergency alert triggering is a standard task for urgent situations, where users can activate emergency alerts with one tap, automatically capturing geolocation data, sending SMS notifications to emergency contacts, and broadcasting alerts through WebSocket connections to connected healthcare providers. Users can manage emergency contacts, add or update contact information, and view emergency alert history. The platform also supports hospital directory browsing, where users can search for nearby healthcare facilities, view contact information and specialties, and access location-based services. For healthcare providers, standard tasks include viewing patient lists with risk levels, accessing provider dashboards that highlight high-risk patients, managing appointments, and viewing patient health trends and statistics. Government users can access population-level analytics, view regional statistics, analyze risk distribution patterns, and generate reports for policy planning.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The MamaCare AI platform integrates with several third-party services to extend functionality and provide critical features that enhance the user experience. The primary third-party integration is Twilio, a cloud communications platform that provides SMS messaging services for emergency alert notifications. When users trigger emergency alerts, the system uses Twilio's API to send SMS messages to registered emergency contacts, ensuring that critical alerts reach family members and healthcare providers even when users are not actively using the application. The Twilio integration is configured through environment variables (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER) and includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable message delivery. The platform also integrates with SMTP email services (configurable for Gmail or other SMTP providers) for sending email notifications, including authentication token emails and system notifications, though email functionality is optional and can be disabled through configuration settings.

The platform utilizes WebSocket technology (websockets library) for real-time bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend, enabling instant updates for emergency alerts, risk assessment notifications, and other time-sensitive information without requiring users to refresh pages or poll the server. While WebSocket is a protocol rather than a third-party service, the implementation uses the websockets library for Python backend and native WebSocket API support in browsers. The platform's architecture is designed to support additional third-party integrations in the future, including payment processing services for subscription management (infrastructure is in place but payment processing is not yet implemented), calendar integration services for appointment scheduling, and potentially telemedicine platforms for video consultations. The system's modular architecture and API-first design facilitate easy integration with additional third-party services as needed, with clear separation between core platform functionality and external service dependencies. All third-party service integrations include comprehensive error handling, fallback mechanisms, and configuration options that allow administrators to enable or disable specific services based on deployment requirements and available resources.

## 8. Access, Authentication, and Authorization

The MamaCare AI platform implements a comprehensive security system for access control, authentication, and authorization that ensures only authorized users can access appropriate resources and perform permitted actions. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), where users register or log in by providing email and password credentials, which are verified using bcrypt password hashing with appropriate cost factors that make brute-force attacks computationally infeasible. Upon successful authentication, the system generates a JWT token signed with a secret key and includes user identification and role information, with tokens expiring after 24 hours to limit the window of vulnerability if tokens are compromised. The JWT token is stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence across browser sessions, and the frontend automatically includes the token in the Authorization header of all API requests, allowing the backend to identify users without requiring database lookups for each request.

The authorization system implements role-based access control (RBAC) with three distinct roles: patient, provider, and government. Each role has access to specific resources and functionalities appropriate to their responsibilities, with middleware functions that validate permissions before processing requests. Patients can access their own health records, risk assessments, appointments, and emergency contacts, while healthcare providers can view patient lists, access provider dashboards, manage appointments, and view patient health trends. Government users have access to population-level analytics, regional statistics, and aggregate data for policy planning, but cannot access individual patient records to maintain privacy. The frontend routing system implements protected routes that require authentication, with a PrivateRoute component that checks for valid JWT tokens and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. The routing system also implements role-based redirection, automatically directing users to their appropriate dashboard (patient dashboard, provider dashboard, or government dashboard) based on their role after login. The backend API includes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware configured to restrict API access to approved frontend origins, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests. Input validation is enforced through Pydantic schemas that automatically validate and sanitize all incoming data, preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity. The database layer uses parameterized queries through SQLAlchemy, which automatically escapes user input and prevents SQL injection attacks. Sensitive operations such as password changes and profile updates require re-authentication, adding an additional layer of security for critical actions. The system maintains comprehensive audit logs of authentication attempts, authorization checks, and access to sensitive resources, enabling security monitoring and compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.

The frontend interface features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, with a navigation layout that includes a sidebar menu for authenticated users, displaying role-specific navigation options based on the user's role (patient, provider, or government). The interface includes interactive data visualization components such as risk gauge visualizations that display risk levels using color-coded circular gauges (green for low risk, yellow for medium risk, red for high risk), making complex risk assessments accessible to users with varying levels of health literacy. The dashboard interfaces display health trends using line charts for weight progression, area charts for blood pressure trends, bar charts for risk score history, and pie charts for risk distribution, all implemented using Recharts and Plotly.js libraries.

The platform provides a RESTful API interface built with FastAPI that serves as the primary communication mechanism between the frontend and backend, with 14 distinct router modules handling different domains of functionality including authentication, health records, risk predictions, appointments, emergency alerts, pregnancy management, recommendations, statistics, dashboards, hospitals, offline synchronization, translations, and subscriptions. The API interface follows RESTful principles with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and includes automatic API documentation through Swagger UI (available at `/docs`) and ReDoc (available at `/redoc`), enabling developers and system administrators to explore and test API endpoints interactively. The API interface includes request/response interceptors that automatically attach JWT tokens to requests and handle authentication errors, ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend components. The platform also implements a WebSocket interface for real-time bidirectional communication, enabling instant updates for emergency alerts, risk assessment notifications, and other time-sensitive information without requiring page refreshes or polling. The WebSocket interface maintains active connections for each authenticated user, allowing the server to push updates to clients in real-time, which is particularly important for emergency alerts where immediate notification is critical.

The platform includes interfaces for external service integration, including the Twilio SMS API interface for sending emergency alert notifications, SMTP email interface for sending system notifications and authentication tokens, and browser geolocation API interface for capturing user location during emergency alerts. The offline synchronization interface uses browser localStorage and IndexedDB APIs to store data locally when connectivity is unavailable, with a synchronization service that compares local data with server data using timestamp-based conflict resolution when connectivity is restored. The platform's database interface is abstracted through SQLAlchemy ORM, providing a database-agnostic interface that currently uses SQLite for development but seamlessly transitions to PostgreSQL for production, with the ORM handling connection pooling, transaction management, and query optimization. The machine learning interface is implemented through a singleton pattern that loads models once during application startup and provides a prediction interface that accepts health record data, performs feature engineering, applies model inference, and returns risk assessment results with associated metadata including confidence scores and risk factors.
